            We collect user profiles of millions of cinema goers and learn their individual movie taste. JustWatch uses this data to run highly efficient trailer campaigns for movie studios, distributors and VOD services. We retarget people on YouTube, Facebook and other platforms where they spend their time discovering new content. Our campaigns are twice as effective as the industry benchmarks.
